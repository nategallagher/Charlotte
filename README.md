### Installing

After downloading the libraries, follow the instructions here to add them to your Arduino IDE:

	https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries

In the Arduino IDE set the Board to Arduino Micro (or whatever hardware you are using) and try compiling the software. If it doesn't work you may need to go back and see if the libraries were installed properly. If it works then connect your Arduino with a USB cord and upload your code.
